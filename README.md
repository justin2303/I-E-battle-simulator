Webpage Battle simulator for a game called I&E, where the combat is based on another strategy game called Victoria 2.
You play it by running main.html. 
To simulate a battle:
1. Choose your combat width, you do this by pressing update on the combat width box after inputting a value.
2. Create your armies. You create army 1 and 2 by first choosing the unit type, of which there are 6 templates.
Each unit type has its own symbol, but is customizable in stats so that for example infantry can simulate militia, etc.
3. After you choose which unit you want to add, press add unit as many times as you want to add such units to an army.
4. Repeat step 3 till you're satisfied with the armies (you can repeat it at any point).
5. Now there should be a lot of unit icons on the reserve panel of both armies if you did step 3 enough times for both armies.
6. Click on the unit you want to deploy to the map, (army1 goes to top side, army2 goes to bottom side, as attacker
and defender respectively.)
7. Click on the grid, you want to place it on, you should see both buttons highlited in yellow. Then press deploy unit.
8. As units deploy you should be able to see them show up in the deployed panel.
9. You can also move units around in the combat map, by clicking the unit inside the map, the grid to move it to, and press move unit
(as far as manouver stat allows).
10. If you've made a mistake you can delete using the delete button. Press the unit to delete in map, and press the button.
11. Lastly you can setup preset modifiers such as tactics (knight symbol), terrain(mountain symbol), general (hat symbol), 
fort level (fort symbol), dice roll (dice icon, leave alone generally unless you want to force a non random roll).
12. When ready, press the fight button to simulate a combat turn.
13. Keep pressing fight till one army "Yields" or until satisfied, or until one army is routed/destroyed.
14. Retreated units appear in the bottom right retreated panel, while sometimes units get destroyed (<0 organization) and disappear.
15. All along the process you can check the status of any reserve, deployed, or retreated unit by selecting it. Its stats are shown in green
next to the unit stats panel of the templates.
